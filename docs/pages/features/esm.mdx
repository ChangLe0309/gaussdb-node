## ESM Support

As of v8.15.x gaussdb-node supporters the __ECMAScript Module__ (ESM) format. This means you can use `import` statements instead of `require` or `import gaussdb from 'gaussdb-node'`.

CommonJS modules are still supported. The ESM format is an opt-in feature and will not affect existing codebases that use CommonJS.

The docs have been changed to show ESM usage, but in a CommonJS context you can still use the same code, you just need to change the import format.

If you're using CommonJS, you can use the following code to import the `gaussdb` module:

```js
  const gaussdb = require('gaussdb-node')
  const { Client } = gaussdb
  // etc...
```

### ESM Usage

If you're using ESM, you can use the following code to import the `gaussdb` module:

```js
  import { Client } from 'gaussdb-node'
  // etc...
```


Previously if you were using ESM you would have to use the following code:

```js
  import gaussdb from 'gaussdb-node'
  const { Client } = gaussdb
  // etc...
```
