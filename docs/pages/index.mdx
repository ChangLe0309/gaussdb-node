gaussdb-node is a collection of node.js modules for interfacing with your GaussDB database. It has support for callbacks, promises, async/await, connection pooling, prepared statements, cursors, streaming results, C/C++ bindings, rich type parsing, and more! Just like GaussDB itself there are a lot of features: this documentation aims to get you up and running quickly and in the right direction. It also tries to provide guides for more advanced & edge-case topics allowing you to tap into the full power of GaussDB from node.js.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install gaussdb
```

# Version compatibility

gaussdb-node strives to be compatible with all recent LTS versions of node & the most recent "stable" version. At the time of this writing gaussdb-node is compatible with node 18.x, 20.x, 22.x, and 24.x.

## Getting started

The simplest possible way to connect, query, and disconnect is with async/await:

```js
import { Client } from 'gaussdb-node'
const client = new Client()
await client.connect()

const res = await client.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'])
console.log(res.rows[0].message) // Hello world!
await client.end()
```

### Error Handling

For the sake of simplicity, these docs will assume that the methods are successful. In real life use, make sure to properly handle errors thrown in the methods. A `try/catch` block is a great way to do so:

```ts
import { Client } from 'gaussdb-node'
const client = new Client()
await client.connect()

try {
   const res = await client.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'])
   console.log(res.rows[0].message) // Hello world!
} catch (err) {
   console.error(err);
} finally {
   await client.end()
}
```

### Pooling

In most applications you'll wannt to use a [connection pool](/features/pooling) to manage your connections. This is a more advanced topic, but here's a simple example of how to use it:

```js
import { Pool } from 'gaussdb-node'
const pool = new Pool()
const res = await pool.query('SELECT $1::text as message', ['Hello world!'])
console.log(res.rows[0].message) // Hello world!
```

Our real-world apps are almost always more complicated than that, and I urge you to read on!
