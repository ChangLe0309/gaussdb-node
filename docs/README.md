# gaussdb-node docs

This is the documentation for gaussdb-node.

## Development

To run the documentation locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed. Then, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd docs
yarn
```

Once you've installed the deps, you can run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start a local server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) where you can view the documentation and see your changes.
